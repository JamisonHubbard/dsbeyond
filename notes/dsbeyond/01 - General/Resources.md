A Resource is some thing typically tracked as points which heroes can gain and spend.

## Core Resources
These Resources are available to every hero, regardless of class or ancestry.
### Heroic Resource
Every class uses a Heroic Resource to manage the main features and abilities of their class.

| Class   | Heroic Resource |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Censor  | Wrath           |
| Conduit | Piety           |
|         |                 |
### Recoveries
A Recovery allows heroes to regain stamina.
#### Modifications
- A *Censor* with the *Life Domain* can use *Revitalizing Ritual* to grant a bonus to an ally's recovery value or their own when they finish a respite

## Conditional Resources
These Resources are available to heroes only in certain conditions.
### Fate
**Conditions**: *Censor*, 1st-level, *Fate Domain*
The *Oracular Visions* feature adds this resource. Points are gained by gaining victories, are spent to grant an edge to tests, and are lost during respites. 
### Virtue
**Conditions**: *Censor*, 10th-level
The *Virtue* feature adds this resource. Every time you finish a respite, you gain virtue equal to the XP you gained. You spend virtue as if it were wrath, and it remains until spent
