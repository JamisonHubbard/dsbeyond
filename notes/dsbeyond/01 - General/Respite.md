Clicking on the **Respite** button should trigger a popup for confirming intentions and selecting various options for completing the respite.

Additionally there should be *Advanced Options* that allow selecting more niche or less used modifiers to the respite.

## Modifications
A *Selective* modification should only be available to certain heroes based on certain conditions. An *Advanced* modification should be available to all heroes as part of the *Advanced Options* menu.
### Selective
- A *Censor* with the *Fate Domain* of at least 4th level should be reminded of their *Oracular Warning* domain feature that grants them and their allies temporary stamina at the end of a respite
- A *Censor* with the *Death Domain* of at least 4th level should be reminded of their *Seance* respite activity
- A *Censor* of the *Oracle* order of at least 5th level resets their pre-rolled 2d10 results from the *Prophecy* order feature during a respite
- A *Censor* of at least 6th level chooses a weapon for their *Implement of Wrath* feature upon finishing a respite
- A *Censor* of the *Creation Domain* of at least 7th level selects a treasure and is granted a temporary, divine version of the treasure upon finishing a long rest
- A *Censor* of 10th level can rest in the presence of their deity during a respite using the *Templar* feature. They should be reminded of their ability to ask their deity 3 questions, and to appear anywhere in the timescape where someone worships their deity afterwards. However they may be given targets to judge by their deity, and suffer their gods wrath should they use this ability again before successfully doing so.
- A *Censor* of 10th level gains Virtue points equal to the number of XP they gained during a respite. They may also at any time spend 3 Virtue to select one of their deity's other domains for using domain features. This selection is reset at their next respite.
### Advanced
- A *Censor* with the *Storm Domain* uses their *Blessing of Fortunate Weather* to select the weather type when they finish a respite. This grants an edge to various skills for them and their allies depending on their selection
- A *Censor* with the *Sun Domain* can use *Inner Light* to grant a +1 bonus to saving throws to themselves or an ally when the *Censor* finishes a respite and until they finish another respite
- A *Censor* with the *Life Domain* can use *Revitalizing Ritual* to grant themselves or an ally a bonus to their recovery value equal to the *Censor*'s level when they finish a respite. This lasts until the *Censor* finishes another respite
- A *Censor* of the *Nature Domain* of at least 7th level uses the *Nature's Bounty* domain feature to prepare a magic meal upon finishing a long rest. They select 2 boons from a list which apply to them and their companions until those creatures finish another respite. These options should be available
- A *Censor* of the *War Domain* of at least 7th level can use the *Your Triumphs Are Remembered* domain feature to gain 1 Victory after a respite. This Victory cannot be converted to XP
